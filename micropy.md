# Micropy CLI

## Using the Stubs
### First use on your computer

Having already [installed micropy-cli](https://github.com/BradenM/micropy-cli#getting-started), clone or [download](https://github.com/cpwood/Pico-Stub/archive/main.zip) this repo and issue the following command:

```
micropy stubs add "<path to pico micropy folder in this repo>"
```

For example:

```
micropy stubs add "C:\Pico-Stub\micropy\micropython-rp2-1_13-290"
```

### When starting new projects

Just follow the [instructions](https://github.com/BradenM/micropy-cli#creating-a-project) over on the Micropy CLI readme!
