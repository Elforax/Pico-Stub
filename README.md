# Pico-Stub

This repository contains MicroPython stubs for the Raspberry Pi Pico, allowing you to benefit from Python code linting and autocompletion in Visual Studio Code.

## Using the Stubs

You can set up Visual Studio Code to use these stubs manually or using [Micropy CLI](https://github.com/BradenM/micropy-cli) (recommended). 

* [Using Micropy CLI](micropy.md#using-the-stubs) (recommended)
* [Manual Instructions](micropython-stubber.md#using-the-stubs) 

## Generating the Stubs

This isn't something you *need* to do; the stubs are already included in this repository within the `stubs` directory.

However, if you want to do this yourself, you can do so using [Micropython-Stubber](https://github.com/Josverl/micropython-stubber).
